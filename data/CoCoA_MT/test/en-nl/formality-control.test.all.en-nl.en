but their prices are just so great, and then they have so many things that you have just sort of try
you understand.
So every case is kind of just like if you can figure out how to get your clients and that's you know
Would you think of some of the biggest morals you learn from your family?
They came from Somalia. They came here, back in their thirties and forties. You know what I mean.
But he did and we ended up going and it was a pretty cool experience. I wouldn't say it was just as positive and enchanting as yours was because that sounds like it
that's not true. English is your first language.
So, what's your legal experience, you have lots of legal experience it sounds like
your mom always sounds so like
you got to teach them values like try trying things to do like, you know what I mean?
What's something that grabs your attention? Is it a type of food? Is it a style? Is it an atmosphere? What do you, what are you going for,
No, I see yours is big and I see mine as almost flat. My volume is maxed and you know my microphone.
Well, and you know, I wonder if men find it a competition to outdo like he said let me get your number from my sister,
Yeah . What was your first job?
You don't have to go food shopping and actually take care of yourself.
and I was like I am so smart as you know, really figure it out, I have to do something great
I think it's a like form of self-love or meditation of just showing up your best self, that helps you show up your best self.
I have seen that I've seen he is getting a little taller and you've got to start checking him soon, try to fight that
Yes, very much woman affection so, for instance, it would be a terrible thing to cover with your child. That would ruin your child.
It's because your family makes it so that the oldest person gets the crappiest sleeping arrangement but my family makes it so that the youngest person has that.
Like you, I may test your TV.
I always wonder what if your parents watch it? The show like do they, you know.
we can talk a little bit about the Oscars. I'm wondering if I can just hear about your favourite movies at the moment. Both for a year, going into the awards season
we're not going to be able to sleep. Obviously, your security team is ill-equipped to deal with this. This is like insanity that we're not having to call a third time
between meters and just everything, and even just worrying about your car getting clipped. Parking is a real pain in the butt. How do you find parking in Astoria?
without the same apartment that you now are recently. Okay, then I was at your apartment, I felt that it's your apartment, I just didn't know if that's your current apartment.
I don't think there's really anything wrong with that. But, if I told you, it was hurting the economy, does that change your opinion at all? And I'm not saying that it is
Yeah, exactly. Okay now also have a look on my fashion stores where do you shop?
if it's (piled) into you know lower quality I just lose it. Okay, what kinda your favourite movie genre?
Ok, so for your career though, I think you're gonna have to look more professional. Is that something you've thought about at all?
They do, even in Bloomingdale, they also take, they'll return your makeup and stuff,
Now, it's easier to get your money back, but back then it was a whole big thing and you know
You know what I'm saying, whatever you wanna do you could do it. Provide you for everything you wanna do.
You see what I hear from all the things that you've been telling me is that you found new communities for yourself.
while sitting in the back of your car and not having to focus on the road. How many hours a year you spend driving versus how you can use that to be more productive.
Where do you stay on your trip across country?
You know what I am saying my extended family is out of States
So, you never know what you can open yourself up to. Look what you opened yourself up to.
who are your closest friends here?
What was your last vacation?
I think every other way other than that is a worse way. If someone said hey your family is going through a little bit of a crisis okay, don't worry it's nothing that they, it happens to everyone
So, I know you was on your way home, what you're watching tonight?
I don't know about this. I don't know if that's ever happened to you, I mean having (your arm bit mouth) is pretty significant
taking them to park and let them run around and get tired, you know what I am saying so they go to sleep
and so I'll just get it started by asking you this. Where's your favourite place you've ever been?
So okay, we've got like a minute left and so we can do teach you there and maybe we can try
It's like a really nice TV for forty bucks or something and he literally ran to the Fourteenth Street at ten o'clock at night, but you have this.
Can I have your phone number, please?
I'll have to figure out, what he did because it was something where you could pick certain channels, he searched them to know about,
like my childhood was you know how we grew up just being fun, chilling, enjoying ourselves, do all we gotta do, then in the middle part it was just school
What's your favourite brand? you have a favourite brand that is athletic or casual or a little fancier than what you feel like. Let me check out style.
you wanna go to school, they're gonna help you to school, you know what I am saying that's how family is
I think even your PayPal email address.
Are they willing to take part in that part of your life.
I think just because, in terms of species, like you said, humans are (developed). Probably looked a little weird. You think your
therefore, I've got them forever. because the drive, they die or you can't get them on to your hard drive.
You know they have to create their own label, they will have to go to the post office and get postage and making out, we definitely did not make it the easiest possible for the return
so you put family over work first? you put work first? You put work first over family
but it was weird to have that much time in the late afternoon you know and have your whole workdays.
It's all oil and then you can't. it's all oil and it turns into plastic,
you know, this seems like the line can be really long.
Yeah, if you can spend the money it's definitely on your side.
you don't need it, but you buy it all the time, and you know, if you summed up your monthly bills, it would take up a little percentage there?
I got a lot of families like that, they teach your life and show your life
Being safe and protecting yourself from STDs and stuff like that.
yeah, family will always be there, especially moms and pops, the moms always take care of you
that just feels so big it might seem little in the beginning, it is really super big, stuff that they're doing for you.

She loves you, Yeah, yeah, yeah! Only because we played it while I was in Junior High band and we thought we were cool!
Really, I'm in Fla. we have our areas. But self driving is scary! Since you live in the cold, why would it be illegal to warm up your car in Ohio?

lol I had an African grey that could say everything I said around the house. Like clean your room! as well any loud sounds.
yikes, I don't think that name would go over so well in the USA lol. It was so nice chatting with you, enjoy your day!
I did. Now I step on them as a parent. Did you play with them?
Yeah and also, many people don't know there's really no correlation between connection quality and service bars either. To answer your question, I'm not sure. What does Minnie Mouse stand for?
I agree! What are your views on the Golden State Warriors?
Good question! They also owe IGN the gaming website. Do you game?
No I didn't but I totally agree with you. I guess Dubai is in a desert region so they need a lot of water to keep the grass green but it still seems wrong just to play golf on it.
that must be an awesome spectacle to watch it eat. a good way to get rid of your enemies! LOL
The sax is a great instrument. your son will learn to appreciate music much more. anyway, great chat!
I would use a rocket launcher LOL just kidding. do you watch soccer at all? Apparently soccer makes more than all other sports combined
Yes you are correct. Despite the students mourning due to a mass shooting a day earlier, Republicans appeared only a fox where they wouldn't be pressed about gun control
I have taken yoga before but I need a few more classes before I get more flexible. It was fun chatting with you, have a great day!
Yes they can. So you can use amazon to help with your life and then use them for entertainment. After all, they've now got their own film and tv studio.
Yes, I have. There good! Have you?
i think yes. Tuesday night after the Game 2 loss, Brooks alluded to the possible change by responding to a question about Scott's success in the backup center role. what is your opinion?
That is crazy, I would totally do it, would you upload your memory?
Yes, your height is great for corner kicks. maybe as a goalie too. Anyway, great chat!
