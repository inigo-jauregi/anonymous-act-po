the quickly they could get me where I need to be.
DJ Hu or whatever I will give myself some credit
What was your favorite Disney movie growing up?
ya I think he won a dancing championship actually! I guess martial arts are just dance moves used for defending yourself haha
Yesterday was very warm. When it's very warm like that, and then it suddenly drops, makes it extra cold to me anyway. I feel like my body gets ready for the cold, then it's like.
I like schooled in London by myself. So it was really fun. And, even though I was like technically going to school but that was a vacation.
So, did your friend know that this is what happens in these get-togethers or she was just clueless?
Me neither. I could never be a professional dancer.
Yeah, tell me about it. Okay, tell me that story bro.
excuse me. But anyway I've enjoyed the last calendar year of different trips
Yes they donate clean water. And they will donate a day of clean water for every minute you do not use your cell phone apparently. I need to look into that more
Good morning, yes I do. How about yourself?
Yes, me too. I like to listen to jazz from time to time. There;'s even a woman in Harlem that has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every Saturday for 20 years.
i agree with you. it happened several years ago. it says pro-trumpers found them and posted them to social media. that seems odd...
I don't need that bringing stuff up in me and then I react wrong, I need to have a handle on my stuff and know how I react so that I'm prepared for this situation, feel me?
Can I have your phone number from which you called us previously?
I think I have read that before as well, I think it would be so wild to see your manager take an at bat!
Yeah. I always tell my wife that if she ever leaves, I am going with so don't get any ideas. I say that because I am never dating again. I supervise 30 millenials and their dating habits confuse me.
So let us see what we got here. But first of all how was your party?
Yeah, that is kind of odd! Well, it's been nice chatting with you, I need to go walk my dog, now.
oh what games have you played? I used to play a lot of them but the more recent ones havent been great
Do you have other favorite movies from this year or from your life?
I think it would be pretty cool. Do you play minecraft?
And he apparently was depressed and his mom asked my mom to ask me to ask him to come to this party.
Let me guess, they have a McDonalds with free WiFi? I could never climb Everest. I would have to rebel against my internet addition and put down my device long enough to climb... I'll just Google it...
The state rock song of Oklahoma is "Do You Realize?" by the Flaming Lips. I didn't know that states had rock songs.
Well, I was going to say so I think my sophomore or junior year of high school, me and my family went down to Orlando for Christmas.
Are they willing to take part in that part of your life.
And it was me, her, my grandma, my parents, and Joe, Jackie for whatever reason wasn't there, and it was really fun. It was really weird and fun
Haha! You sound like me. I do watch certain TV shows when I can. Me and my dog sit on the sofa and veg out lol....we like the travel channel sometimes.
where you know you can clean yourself when you go to the washroom in terms of oils and scents and all that stuff, absolutely everybody smelled wonderful, it was just the hygiene and it's awesome.
we don't like that down here my mother's not really into sports like that my Moms like sports first.
I don't know sounds kind of creepy to me! Almost like the work of fiction! Like something from someones imagination!
and having someone ring you up and throw in the bag for you, I mean they need to create a reason for the people that actually come into a store
It's always something to do, I mean it's just worth your time like I hate wasting my time.
The movie was awful first of all and then what was funny is my friend always falls asleep in the movie theaters and they have these things at the back of your
Wow, did you ever try any of the baseball games on playstation?
mine is said to expand the period of fasting when you wake up and to try to go as long as you can without having that breakfast meal.
Yeah! He was the mouse king in the Nutcracker. Thats pretty cool, I would definitely never have guessed that about him.
Not really. I'm a homebody. But from my chair, the internet can take me just about anywhere. Are you a traveler?
lol, yes, That was since January 2017. I love my Iphone its with me most of the day, like everyone else.
If the goats get stock options, sign me up. I can eat grass. I'm not proud.
do all the stuff and just because it's just family first over everything and just doing that and just following that it's just it means a world to me
I see, that's why I say be single and mingle, so you don't have to worry about hurting nobody's feelings and you don't have to worry about getting your feelings hurt
I think I had definitely a lot of what you were talking about. Like I always, for example like my best friend ((myself, Matt and Tylarl)) have been best friends since forever
I agree with you. Michael Bay is an ok director though, he directed the movie The Rock which is really good.
I don't know what you mean? There is a group called transhumanist's that want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks!
Waking up at 4 was tough when I first started but now, it's second nature. It's really a great option for me because I have no time to do it other wise. Its so relaxing and clears my mind.
It has, my favorite pop song is We Are the Champions and its actually voted as the catchiest song by a group of scientists
you know, this seems like the line can be really long.
And it was strange to talk about myself in front of people, I don't know
I was going to ask what you thought about it. Jack Black was going to star in the Green Lantern which was originally supposed to be a comedy.
I know, and when you think about it it doesnt take much time just have to incorporate them as habits in your routine.
I thought it was great too! It really surprised me that it was so good!  It's also impressive about that super computer don't you think?
Kind of related, but I have totally tried to Google things when my power is out. Haha.
If I'm watching a movie at home I don't care about the reviews as much but definitely want to make sure I am getting my moneys worth at the theater.
his sister is my father's, his mother is my father's sister, and she, I notice she has anger issues and felt they felt sorry about who goes to see them
Not mine either. I'm surprised that there are no economic gains for the countries that have played host to the Olympics or the World Cup. I wonder if it's because they spend so much on the infrastructure for the events?
Honestly, it would hurt to throw a phone as high as you could, and even to attempt to catch it with your hands. Needs some setup. Avoiding hitting yourself in the face.
I think every other way other than that is a worse way. If someone said hey your family is going through a little bit of a crisis okay, don't worry it's nothing that they, it happens to everyone
I do, what do you think about Prices injury?
That is funny. I always thought of them as a punishment hat. Well it has been nice chatting with you have a good evening.
Didn't see the Last Samurai.  I heard they were making a TG sequel - wonder how that will be received?
Yeah, but, to me that is pretty good improvisation for whoever came with that idea.
like us in the beginning, they'll be talking to the crowd, and they'll be, Wow you guys really are good friends of mine or with the new band, you know, come on the road with you
I am trying to inquire about your current offers on movie tickets.
Serious she got but my youngest son he's into puzzles, he likes puzzles, (indoor) games
Yeah when you think about how basic that system was compared to what they have today. I think ps3 will last a long time though just because it will play blurays. that is about all I use mine for anymore.
Yes, I have. There good! Have you?
I read that and thought the same. I wonder how similar the Zebra Fish is to humans? Can we use that in medical research?
sit down and make sure everybody on your Twitter feed see the real deal
Of course - a little before my time, but very influential in the Rock/Punk Rock scene. Ramones kinda started the live rock scene in NYC - or at least were the kings of it for some time
did you throw your order into a wooden trunk?
Do you wear a costume for halloween ever?
all of my friends and family were like oh yeah we hated that guy and I was like why didn't you say anything to me about it
When by myself, I'm the biggest target. For every, all the people try. All the camels, you know.
I know that's what the whole neighbourhood has, it has definitely changed
Good chatting with you too. Enjoy your clothing. I will enjoy mine.
you know, it's like fields trip field day, you know field day
you got to teach them values like try trying things to do like, you know what I mean?
Who is your favourite actor? I guess, like the same thing.
I thought I heard about Elon Musk in Inception, but I cannot recall what character he played?  I've seen that movie several times to try to understand it!
Yes!  I believe you are correct.  The triplets in the movie are named the Bimbette sisters.  That's your useless fact of the day.  lol
Yeah I didn't spend my time in college trying to make companies either, I wish I did though.
Cool beans!  It's been nice chatting with you this morning.  I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
Yeah, usually when my home team is doing good.
I used to play that too. Did you Tom Hanks brother does woody's voice in video games?
with my big vacation down to Florida for a couple of days. And then in South southwest
Yeah she was in it, I though she was pretty good, you should definitely watch it, great movie.
yes me too. some of them can eat prey twice their sizew
I took a horse ride once and live in an area with lots of horses. They are beautiful animals. you?
if you are gonna get diner food, like Denny's is not gonna be your best culinary option.
Yeah I actually I really did like your ideas, those ideas sounded to me like why isn´t somebody in a position of power actually thought them that few things but, you know
Apparently, 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed. It's depressing to me.
And they encouraged me to download it and I was like, oh I have it. And then I was like, would I have it on my phone though?
I guess they must show respect for each other. The rap battle in which your glorious opponent is also worthy of respect.
hmm that seems dumb like its just playing with words, do you like Teddy Roosevelt? apparently he had over 20 pets, or as they say in Colorado, "Guardians" haha
That's funny because he was very tall. He kept his important documents inside his hat. I guess that hat was pretty big.
I cried when I saw that part. Still makes me sad. She also suggested Leia's good luck kiss...
help me get some money, make some money give me money, you know what I am saying
There was a long time where he said I am not going to have any of your non-Jewish friends at my Shabbat table. And I said okay that's your prerogative, it's your choice
Cream in your coffee. Yeah well, you gotta figure those sugar also in the cream.
No, I've never been to turkey. Have you been?
I would rather have amazon prime for life than a building named after me.
yes. the end is pretty tough. enjoy your mind while you can. probably genes and environments. Anyway, great chat.
Cat Woman! and you who is yours? If they had made Batman with Bill Murray ad Eddie Murphy I would expect to laugh. I just look at Bill Murray and he makes me laugh!
the old friend of mine used to work there. It's so funny
your brother would eat that up. Oh my God.
I didnt know that, do you have any favorite bands? used to like Linking Park
basketball coach, he could be your family, you know what I am saying
Hmm, sounds familiar but I haven't. Is it sci-fi? I love to read and have done some writing myself, including sci-fi.
Interesting. Have you ever had carpel tunnel syndrome brought on by playing games?
Well me personally. I would rather watch third rock any day. Those other shows were quite popular in their day though.
Looked very cool, when he did it! I heard somewhere that Tupac danced ballet. Have you heard anything about that?
YES ;) mine too. That vocal was amazing ! ;) was... such a shame...
Yes Earth has been around for a long time for sure. So interesting to me is that Earth is about 71% covered with water. The other 29% is land and various Islands.
Yeah, that made me a little hungry. Did you like Michael Jackson?
in the different stages of my life, you know family, hard work, dedication, loyalty, honesty. So I feel if my kids learn that and they value family
Do you have any favourite spots or favourite memories about some of that, you know, if you stayed in your hotel or whatever the case might be?
So you worked out yourself naturally. Okay, that's great.
I agree! The Marvel cinematic universe takes place in earth -199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book multiverse, earth-616!
i never realized how good dogs were at knowing what pointing is. but if you point, a dog will follow your finger. its great
he is a great guy! i think he is a great guy and a tremendous actor. what film of his is your favorite?
Interesting. If you think about it, a lot of power comes from water.
Yeah, it´s the same My my dad is a lawyer and wanted to push me into law forever. My mum is a therapist
let me just. I can again. it's funny because football season is about to end and it's like that's it. I watch TV during football season and then after football season I was just like
Do you feel like you lose anything shopping online? Like not seeing things in person? Not touching them, not feeling them, not holding it in your hand, you know?
Oh, my God, what's wrong with you, are the only person ever who said that.
and she'd like spread my legs open and like stand in between, you know, and like, I don't know, for me it was just so weird.
I mean - I think it is definitely music...but I agree not my type.
I wondered if the celebrity Anne Hathaway's name is inspired from that. I had no idea Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time! They would've seemed to live in different eras to me.
Yeah!  I was wrong... It was Musk's wife that was in Inception.  I have no idea what she looks like.  Nolan got his son in the movie too.
That sounds delicious, is that your favorite omelet?
they hate you, they just make up a reason to hate you
really? What do you think it's gonna bring people into your carpet whereas
He called me and had me come in and I was well I was working in the cafe end they needed my help while I was working outside like it was trashy
I saw the movie. It has Leonardo DiCaprio I think it was directed by Ridley Scott. I actually liked that movie a lot. did you see the movie Wonder Woman by the way
I didn't say anything I just kept my mouth shut. But so we went I told myself now that we are in Miami we have to eat and it's really close
what about all aunts, uncles, cousins? your parents have any siblings there. How, how big is that Thanksgiving Day
That's crazy, my computer is fairly new but I have no idea how many gigs it has!
It's kind of an odd thing but it's easy for me to remember because Sunday is the day that my boss took the schedule for the week. So I'm going to exit out.
the giant debacle and the other girl was in drama class with me so it was this very awkward situation where I was like I didn't know I wasn't trying to hurt you
Oh, I know, Decades. There was so much and people today have no idea how great alot of it was!!
my mom would never send me cash or give me food.
Okay so as a consumer, you don't really care about who makes it, who it makes money for, who it helps employ, you just want to get the best price for yourself.
On my phone it's Google like you. On my laptop it's Cortana by I don't use it much.  I didn't know there was a male Siri -- a British guy?
I think that in this day and age, you need to capture the younger viewer to make your medium longer lasting. They may not relate to the same jokes that have sustained the comic industry for so long.
How interesting! Have you watched Game of Lions? Maybe that would interest me more because it is about the lives of lions.
None. I am pretty sure federer could have hit me in the head with a tennis ball on his serve and I would not have known about the serve for a few minutes...
Yeah when you said, oh, my friend Lily. Have you met my friend? Yeah, she was on her wedding. She's at the wedding. She taught me early before school and after school to Vietnam kids, so she learned
I know and that cartoon practically took over my life.
And are just so different from mine and I really enjoy just having a conversation with him just to see those differences where the coffee project made an event
while sitting in the back of your car and not having to focus on the road. How many hours a year you spend driving versus how you can use that to be more productive.
We don't think you should go if you can't find your wallet and I was like, no, I can find it. So I got it and then we went downtown
Yeah, she is a friend of mine
i think yes. Tuesday night after the Game 2 loss, Brooks alluded to the possible change by responding to a question about Scott's success in the backup center role. what is your opinion?
Ok, so for your career though, I think you're gonna have to look more professional. Is that something you've thought about at all?
I really enjoyed myself.
Yes a lot of them are actually deaf. What do you think about Elon Musk by the way? I know that's a change of topic haha
While I'm a pet owner, that going a bit far. Do you give dogs and cats rights, how about those dairy cows or cattle to be eaten. Do they get lesser rights?
I think it's good that Apple banned it. The app creator seemed to want to create havoc lol. I hope you have a good rest of your evening!
Sonic in a rock band? I guess he has the haircut for it. He could probably have joined Whitesnake.
I think we can move onto the next subject which is what is that we are talking about anyway how Amazon is replacing retail?
Good Morning! Do you like to watch horror films?
I do. I used to play a lot but not any more. Do you play too?
Yeah, can't make good choices when your sugar has dropped! It can't believe it took until 1993 for women to wear pants on the senate floor.
Funny. I would love to learn more about a jellyfish that is immortal.
I'd say we have to research it both ways, and then my friend I think it was somewhere around the time of Black Friday or something,
which is cool. I went to Greece because a really close friend of mine was gonna speak with her husband
because that's handmade or, I mean it is meant to disintegrate basically in a year
That's a throw back! I wanted to like that game so much but my friends were so much better than me so I decided to hate those games...
With me being of African decent myself. I consider myself as a oral historian or praise singer
I did not know that. So if comics are not are thing, where to do get your entertainment from?
I don't either, I wonder if it triggers something in your brain. Kind of crazy. Do you have a favorite shirt?
Yeah me too but it sounds like they used to use animals more. Truman seem to take that very seriously especially at Disneyland.
you just, the only thing that is fucked up is, your weekend and your holidays and all things like that are booked.
A moment there you're tempted to go into somebody's apartment, and take them and be like, oh sorry we rented it out to me for short term and now I'm taking it.
Hm. I thought it was animation. I guess you mean the remake? I never saw that. It was probably great as well.
Oh that's awesome but girl let me tell you, so it sounds like Amber girl you guys have everything set for your beautiful, tranquil, loving, romantic
so the weight would be just your brew ratio of whereas the TDS is the total dissolved solids is what it stands for
Will Smith and Brat Pitt are the ones that declined the role, and yeah I bet they though it was going to be a lousy movie.
like you selling, that's like you really have to be making it for a low cost.
So, what's your legal experience, you have lots of legal experience it sounds like
I wonder if that person even shows up to vote, or why he's in the jungle like that haha. Did you vote last election?
Our kids, they don't get the chance to enjoy school and enjoy the stuff that school is more enjoyable, kids will have more fun with it, when I was growing up, that was part of my family value
saying all this stuff. Like these are the options like Catholicism says that this is a sin but these are your option.
So, I know you was on your way home, what you're watching tonight?
I could definitely see that. What were your favorite video games? Jane McGongiai was the game designer behind that study, pretty cool.
yes, burglars can be pretty quick, so you need to "stay on your toes" when it comes to tying your shoes.
I love me some disney movies! Which is your favorite?
That concerns me.
Yep. And especially if you're lying too, and then you are intentionally getting caught in your lies. Then you also make yourself, you look not smart.
Yes, I heard that too! That's strange to think about. Egosurfing is a term used when looking yourself up on the internet. I would think that would be for those who do it alot!  Good chat!
I've never worked with a brick oven myself.
That's how much I pay for me and my mother and Maggie's bill with the phone Yeah.
decent salary to put on a show somewhere and then go home and not be like, Oh my god, the rent is so expensive or, you know, I'm living in it. You're living in Los Angeles
if it's (piled) into you know lower quality I just lose it. Okay, what kinda your favourite movie genre?
Yeah good call they sure do to me too! And yeah those eggs are massive, I know people eat those and ostrich eggs.
and doing more but, I just don't see my family as much as I needed to, I wish I had more time, do other stuff
earn by that, because there was this South Korean deli, I think the second street of the Avenue A and then they opened up Gracefully and it's just
Yes, it is such a good idea. I try to feed mine by hand as well as any local strays near my home
Oh yeah, that would have been good. Are you interested in history? I was reading about Lincoln. He had a high pitched voice, I guess.
Nope. Glad they used the nickname, Minnie. What's your favorite Disney film?
so I could very much feel myself getting very angsty and resistant
So you've got to work a nice balance in between
I recently switched from the Australian voice to the U.K version, gotta keep my women interesting fresh!
What's happening, something weird is happening on my network do you hear me now?
me and Rodney went bang, shoulder to shoulder, and my shoulder still clicks to this day. I never got it looked at. I never got it fixed. You know
I was, a friend of mine at the University of Virginia is actually friends with benefits with daughter, they hand out, they're pretty close friends.
Oh I didn't know that. Have you seen that movie is it any good?
Now, it's easier to get your money back, but back then it was a whole big thing and you know
I agree! Look...I love my sleep but there are some birds who fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping when migrating. Exhausting!
Yeah. Have you ever ridden in the jurassic park ride?
and they give me just good ideas and then I save them to my list on amazon and then I'll eventually get around to buying them or it'll take me down a hole and I can
maybe they should shorten it to like socball lol sounds better to me.
you never had any parties in your house.
Hi! So do you like music? I love rock music and well many other genre's.
Yes, but video are viewed more negatively than TV, that is why you have legislation in some countries limiting the time played by children.
And the stories are about your interactions with children?
Wow that is hard to believe although I have been on that ride and it is so much fun. The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park only appear in the film for 15 minutes surprisingly. It was nice talking with you today.
Yeah. It is creepy and that's why it took me so long to go to New Orleans because I have been wanting to go to New Orleans forever but I refused to go after Katrina. It broke my heart
They just give me a bank account with enough zeroes in it that I don't have to worry about it, my kids don't have to worry about it, my grandkids don't worry
I mean in terms of hospitality, what are you thinking about restaurants? Like if you go out to a restaurant, it's your birthday. Where are you headed? Like you choose anywhere anyway,
So we're at an hour. Alright, so so the guys will send me back and thank
you're like, this was crap, take it back.
Yup. well it was nice chatting with you have a good day.
yes, like I just get along with my wife's mother, I don't really get along with my father
Yeah, you can just get rid of it, I mean cut your cost.
Reminds me of the Matrix, where he downloads information into his brain and is instantly an expert. I'd rather take my time and be entertained and relaxed!
Wow, that is a long time to take to write a script. Well, nice chatting with you!
I don't know but tom hanks played walt disney in that movie apparently, I've never seen it myself
Hang it up to dry somewhere. What do you want from me?
I love Tywin Lannister actually LOL I think Daenerys is kind of boring personally but that's just me, I also like the little finger but he's dead now LOL
That's strange - makes me wonder if you play a concert for no audience - is it really a concert?
Really?  Which ones did that?  Seems like you always hear of big names rejecting parts and then finding out the movies do fantastic.
If you ever get a chance you should check this show, there's some amazing creatures down there. 84% of genes that are associated with diseases have counterparts in the Zebrafish.
Minerva.  Her name is actually Minerva Mouse.  I think Minnie suits her much better don't you?
so they were pulling up my phone number or from specific bell or whatever what might have been to time wanner,
it's really good to me. I really like it.
I've applied for some job that the ASPCA, unfortunately, I don't think they would pay enough that I would even begin to support myself
you know what I am saying?
He just wanted me to do science
You know your Disney films! I enjoy animation, but usually the ones for adults, not kids.
especially since I guess, unlike your family, in his case none of us really follow the path so to speak.
and so I'll just get it started by asking you this. Where's your favourite place you've ever been?
Well, that's everybody's choice. Nobody forced you, put a gun to your head and said you must put this device in your house. nobody's forcing anybody to go buy everything from amazon. They're choosing to do it.
I like them I like having my kids watching a lot of animation stuff with my family and doing all that to dragon balls,
And now that feels just like I'm not worth it to me but, it is incredible how expensive it is and like not worth it.
Yeah, my high school boyfriend tried to get me to watch Star Wars but I never really got into it. Yeah. I'm sure it is. I mean even maybe if it wasn't trying to
now I've done, I don't know. Let me see, look at my stats. But anyways, you see the progress in each child that even if they have another teacher, it's a good thing.
Okay, coming on to the next thing which is what concerns me the most? What concerns you the most?
that's why I have them around my parents and stuff like that
I've never used it, it is hilarious, because I have an iphone. I don't have alexa, I'm scared it will spy on me.
And so where it truly fell apart is that is when my mom was out of town and she would be there to look after me and make sure that
you see I liked Force Awakens a lot. I like Kylo Ren. its a different spin because he conflicted and not just all big bad and evil
it was a poor choice yes. and the way they showed Luke was not to my liking either...
Interesting. I know people in Boulder, I'll have to ask them that. Well nice chatting with you.
Snowwhite. My mom told me I probably watched it like every single day. I'm very excited
and then I think when you choose your speciality then you gotta learn even more.
I guess I'm just talking to myself again.
I know I was shocked the day that I left Wendy's and my phone asked me how my visit was! My daughter laughed so hard.
Yeah it's very interesting to hear about it because, to me it's actually very similar. My relation to that is very similar to my relationship to religious believers.
you're gonna have to tag all these cheap clothing coming out of China, because clothing is only second to oil and in carbon footprint.
But he did and we ended up going and it was a pretty cool experience. I wouldn't say it was just as positive and enchanting as yours was because that sounds like it
Do you want to list more people or should I keep going? Let me keep on going. Let's see I got, I have my friend
I did but I didn't really play it all that much, my brothers did though.
yes, I have actually. I've made that before my mom raised me making it in the microwave. She would make rice
it blows my mind to think about it! We truly are just so tiny in comparison to everything else
Let's check it out because we were young we were sort of excited for what sort of might happen. And my friend at that time said let me grab a bat just in case
LOL. Well, it wasn't designed for tourists! I guess you learned your lesson. Still, thanks for helping keep Istanbul clean!
that's crazy and people tell me they have got a lot of family members and stuff like fifty cousins  that's a whole lot of people
Yeah I wouldn't mind just being a voice, I always wanted to work for my local radio station lol.
beautiful storytelling so me and my roommates got a little obsessed with it last semester since we started watching to the cast and you could tell the whole cast
I doubt it. They wouldn't they thought that are going to happen.
lol, I agree with you!! I didn't know Nevada is the only state to have a none of the above voting option?
That is really expensive I agree, did you watch the Lego Batman movie?
Beauty and the Beast is my wife's favorite.  Mine is Lion King.  Do you have a favorite Disney movie?
I got to travel and see my family seeing them more is
Yeah, me there, I just wait for a long time to the next store and which are my biggest expenses.
I haven't heard of that game, either. There's a game I play where you get better by doing daily tasks. I should make an AI device to do it for me!
Do you think Rotten Tomatoes is a good site for reviews
No, so is your friend staying there permanently, where do the children staying and how is her relationship with their husband and how are things there because of work or is he closer to his family.
gonna get a lot of something I do every day anyway because I couldn't afford to do it every day, but you know it's surprising to me how much the crap food really is?
Do you feel like you learned a lot from your kids and stuff?
I did not know that. Very interesting. Well, it was good chatting with you.
Wow, today you could play with them so they could meet them too
But I mean, to know your thoughts on baseball because baseball is pretty fenced up, either it's a strike, or it's not a strike, but the human error aspects.
I figure I could plan ahead. Maybe a long weekend. That would give me time to digest.
rebel against them and then, later on, you come to realize, oh you know what it was a really good thing they did for me and I shouldn't have fought so hard on it, you know
You know. The phone really, I mean. I feel half the time my phone is quicker and easier to get, get me information than my computer is but into the go faster.

That makes total sense to me! I feel like we are spoiled when it comes to the sun's energy!
Somehow they think it stops thieves. I can only assume that you can put flame throwers anywhere on your vehicle. That way, if the thief comes to the door you can deter him.
That crossed my mind too.  A monkey would be of concern for me too.  Eventually a line has to be draw.
Washing it every day isn't like work for me. I feel like taking a shower. It's actually easier sometimes to get my hair wet than it is to try and not get my hair wet.

Yes, that is something that really makes me worried for the human being. I get it, is something that is going to happen, and we are contributing to that, but, I hope our grandkids still can get a good job.

it never was for me so, for better or worse I don't know what I got to say
Oh! A friend of mine actually lives there, so I was going to visit with her and it was really nice because I didn't have to get a hotel room and things like that so.
When we were younger, your phone case and your clip, that was a fashion accessory, and it really isn't anymore. Your phone is just your phone. People have kind of moved past that.
I think we see the light at the end of the tunnel! Enjoy your weekend!
I think that he is a great actor, Ive always thought he had mad skills and think its kind of dangerous him doing his own stunts

The fate of the Dodo always makes my wife cry.  They appear to have been so trusting, which is what to their demise.

It's because your family makes it so that the oldest person gets the crappiest sleeping arrangement but my family makes it so that the youngest person has that.
having some kind of dessert afterwards whether it's a little piece of chocolate like my mouth immediately says to me like, you have to get some sugar, strange!
When I get rich, my first thing is to get my father a Superbowl ticket, that'd be great. Doing stuff like that

Do you apologize to your dog when you accidentally trip over him? I do. I even find myself saying "excuse me" sometimes to my dogs! LOL!

Yes indeed, interesting facts that will give me pause this weekend. That was an enjoyable conversation. Thanks and have a lovely weekend.
I put my kids first, especially before I put work and other stuff. So, my kids always come first, before work, so it is always family first.
Me too, what do you think about Fox news? Apparently they are watched more than msnbc and cnn combined.
You own your personality that shapes who you are and there's just no guarantee, there's just no textbook that can teach you all these things for sure.

I'm going through everything to devise a plan because there's so much to cancel but I just wanna first organize myself before I actually.

That is over 150 earth years, don't get a mortgage from a banker on Neptune, your grand-grand-grand-children will still have payments.

While my favorite is Hulk, I did really like the Captain America movie. It's the best of both worlds because he meets up with Tony Stark.

But at the same time, it's just the return, it's just the amount of stuff I return
No, the only bird I ever cook is chicken; I'm looking to expand my skillset, though! They're the most numerically successful class of tetrapods.
a friend of mine had seriously considered doing a food truck. She and her boyfriend were gonna go in on it and she was gonna cook whatever
probably meant well at least, for me, I feel like most parents ultimately want what's best for them and even if they don't always show it in the best way or the way that
since sixth grade because they wanted me to switch to softball and play with the girls, and I didn't want to. I never played softball. I never played softball in my life. so I quit.
You know what I'm saying. You want them to teach you something new.
I remember thinking just about everything in the prequels' timeline was off, based on the mental version of the past the OT led us to construct. But I'd have to rewatch to nail it down.
I cut off my coffee recently. If I've been pushing myself to drink a lot more water but I cannot live without my sparkling water. I don't know what it is.
No, I see yours is big and I see mine as almost flat. My volume is maxed and you know my microphone.
I do, every year a new costume, you know Panda researchers wear a panda costume for work.
I don't even have to call, and sit on hold, and push the buttons, or whatever. I just enter in my cellphone number, and they call me, automatically, and then I'm instantly connected to a person who solves my problem.
I wish I knew enough about the background to have an opinion, but the last Star Wars I watched was Episode III, when it came out on video. I really need to rewatch to refresh my memory of it.
No I didn't but that's neat! I don't think I asked, but what games do you or did you play?
I mean, she is not clear that was my favourite show growing up. I mean, I know you didn't ask me anything, but the coffee show was the best.
Yeah i generally get music from there but if i'm stuck on something like fixing my car or computer then it's good to have.
Hmm. Do you hunt? Or are the deer protected in your area? There are lots of places that restrict such things.
Yeah, I mean it sounds like you had a great experience than me. I mean, the reason why I like Ireland
Yeah that is crazy. He's actually a good actor in my opinion, have you seen the movie the Revenant? I didn't know that it was a remake of a 1971 movie
How about basketball, is that more of your thing?
tour places, you think I can't do this myself. I mean there's graffiti on the wall my goodness I ain't just gonna walk down that street.
we were with each other for only a couple of months and I moved to a different town and I was like, hey, I'm booking your trip to Asia, you want to come with me?
I didn't know that. I wonder how many people use it. By comparison to Japan, the US comic book market in the US and Canada is $1.09 billion!
ya that is interesting, it's scary to me that we wilsl run out of helium by the end of this century, I know that it's very important for manufacturing electronics
He's probably losing it a bit to be honest. It wouldn't surprise me.
Hi, thats good,  some places make spaghetti and meatballs as party food, that seems odd to me
ok, yes that's what I read... and somebody needs to explain to me, how using a surrogate really works...
Indeed he doesn't. But I've always liked Chewbacca because he reminded me of a giant dog. Ha! Speaking of dogs, I think it's cool that dogs, along with elephants, are the only animals that understand pointing!
Is that your favourite pizza?
Nice chatting with you too, I think I'm gonna try to look for old baseball cards in my attic
and how to be the best they could be you know what I am saying
lol, I know, I guess the US have more tigers as pets than living wild in Asia.
I mean I dunno. It's never really been a thing for me, some of my friends like are, were so and some of them still are so desperate to get married and I just can't really, I dunno.
haha ya I like that, what is also wild to me is that there are more domesticated tigers living as pets than there are wild tigers living around asia
haha mine too. Do you that all votes in Canada are equal to all the votes in California minus 50 votes.
It's different for you and I am like; why it is different for me? And they would say, because, when you walk around in these weddings, they think, you are part of the wedding party.
Awesome me too. I love that they were inspired by the works of Poe, Stoker, and Shelley.
and you can try to kick me out. We're gonna check in the next day, you're in court
well, all should be like in your paperwork, what times that they can contact you, what to do
Yeah, it seems that way, or maybe rotated at a bigger speed, you know we have an embassador in case aliens arrive to the planet or try to make contact with us.
Some people have different sayings for it. Well, what's yours? Well, okay. So, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars
Yeah, you know what I'm saying. They wanna see you do better, they wanna see you do good. You know what I mean. They they don't wanna see you down. They wanna see you up.
I did. Now I step on them as a parent. Did you play with them?
Yeah, I've seen a lot of that.
I agree with you! Especially with the box office at what it is. I would hate to work for the movie Trojan Wars. They made only 309 dollars on a budget of 15 million!
Although I like a sweet breakfast it's just like it never feels like I'm doing something that's great for myself, you know?
Hey what's up do use Google very often?I really love the company and was surprised to hear that it was founded back in 1998.
there will always be money out there, there will always be a new campaign, there will always be new stuff to do but to having that family not there and that support system it just means everything you know?
ya that makes me really sad, what do you think about fish? I had salmon for dinner so I do think theyre tasty haha
The film I felt he really earned an Oscar for was Jerry Maguire. So memorable. Do you agree?
Yeah, my sister-in-law is a hugger and she'll hug me and I will keep my hands down I don't wanna, I mean, it's like you get wrapped.
Yeah that is so lame to me. If you don't like it, then you learn your lesson and don't buy any more tickets to any more concerts.
Maybe he should. What did you think about that guy findin 3 million dollars worth of old baseball cards in his grandpas attic.
It wasn't that big. I kept bringing it to school so my parents made me get rid of it. It was an albino ball python. I could put it in my pocket. LOL
Nice. How I met your mother was underrated. I really like westworld but I can get confused watching it. I watch a lot of live sports too.
you don't need it, but you buy it all the time, and you know, if you summed up your monthly bills, it would take up a little percentage there?
all the time values that you learned from your family.
Wow, as much as I want to call him insane he seems more qualified than me, but I'm still a skeptic. Are you interested in clothing at all?
interesting. There is a UNICEF program that donates clean water for every minute you do not use your phone.
I was watching that, me and my wife were watching that, we were enjoying that, it was cool, I liked them I didn't even know he had a daughter
I know, Also, I do believe in Japan there is less people under 15 years of age than pets.
I know thats amazing. That would be really nice, my relatives dont collect anything cool like that so Im on my own lol
like what? What happened to your arm? I didn't want to say anything. I wouldn't even know how to say it and I'd say I got cut
That would be scary. When you turn 100 in Japan, the PM sends you a silver cup to celebrate.
family is just crazy, you got a lot of cousins,
There has been the odd rap song that I like, but for me it's cultural. I'm just not from the environment most rappers are and can't appreciate their point of view.
That's cool. I like comedy movies and tv shows. Have you ever seen 3rd rock from the sun?
I do. Can you believe when Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor of CA he never lived in Sacramento, instead he commuted 3 hours every day by private jet.
we were doing I don't know something talking about emotions or whatever acting school and Cathleen was like how did was like when was you and your boyfriend's first kiss and I was like
Probably not although it is just fascinating to me how that journey has changed since USA planted its flag on the moon.
to help save the day and bring the groceries inside the rain. So that was good. You never really have to bring you never have to really save your groceries.
much more like leggings, so I have a lot of those. As opposed to my mom's clothing that she's given me where she's the older style dress pants with
Yeah, it's hard for me to relate to scientists and all of their elaborate theories but Hawking was blessed with wit. He was quite the jokester, which makes him very relatable.
Yeah PlayStation 2 is my favorite! And speaking of PlayStation threes, apparently they were being used to research black holes because they were so powerful
I have a thing against guys named Sam but I got past it. Anyways she started dating she was a year older than me so junior year my sophomore year,
You know so what I did was, I have done shack with somebody and some guy in the Philippines was like you can just close your account and then open a new account and I was like Really?
I thought maybe you had left in your car to go get something to eat at McDonalds...lol
Yeah me too. It seems like they just care about making money. Do you like dancing? I don't very much but Bruce Lee was apparently a great dancer and was a champion dancer in 1958.
So, what is your ideal boyfriend?
How was your senior year in high school. Did you go to senior prom or anything?
You know, depressed, they're not your friend, they're not, it's not your friend walking around and it's like you have to treat
Airbnb like where I'm going to stay, I like to consider transportation, like Bangkok, we didn't even look into it. That was my first international trip by myself with a friend.
and your older son he is tall
I think my grandkid would tell me he grew up to be an electrician farmer there and she levels self-pack something you know.
I've been taking my kids they are real athletic so so I will be going to play basketball with them and doing all that stuff and taking them to games
Yeah I would like to know that myself. There is even a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph! Sounds like a warzone over there!
That is really crazy! What are some of your favorite animals by the way? I know that I really like dogs.
your pops is an old your pops is a different breed
He was an exceptional player, but he doesn't strike me as someone who was quick on his feet. New York should be able to forgive him
Me too, the homecoming series has been my favorite of the bunch. I would love to see a Peter Parker and Tony Stark movie where they both are unaware of their special powers.
That's another thing. You have to think on your feet because they always do things that are unexpected.
do you wear your boots to bed? i had a friend who did that. he was worried that someone would break into his house and he would have to fight them. he didnt want bare feet.
My vacation was more of a staycation. So, I went to Washington DC where I'm from
I have been playing for about 10 years now and another thing I wanted to mention that the golf course consists of 18 holes but if you play the game for fun its usually 9 holes.
I believe Serena has been at the top of her peers about 319 weeks. (Please hit done as my button is not working).
That's and luckily, my jobs allows me time to do that. Even though, I am teaching a lot now since everyone is home with this global pandemic we're having.
both my parents were the people that introduced me to the theatre and I'm always deeply grateful for that. And then my dad when I was
Not in your mouth. Don't put that in your mouth. Don't put that in your mouth!
I am a guitarist. I love playing my guitar. I only play when I am ready for open mic or recording music.
Like you, I may test your TV.
Yeah, I like the food buyer, I don't really find the food to be like so like Oh, my god! Trader Joe's is so incredible.
I do, I would say ninety per cent of my shopping there and there are some speciality items that they don't have whatever I am looking for specific kind of papers or something for a particular recipe,
nice, loved my a sega! Each had great games. I wonder how many colors the Sega had, Nintendo has only 54 colors.
You know, unique experiences ever in a hotel. Ever in your lifetime
They used to make me mad but I didn't use my anger positively like that. Now Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth between 9pm and 12a, They are popular!
I agree, It was nice chatting with you as well. Have a great day!
Which is your favorite film of of the original trilogy?
wow, mine was 2 weeks from the fair lol! It was so nice chatting with you!
Robin Williams had always been a favorite of mine in the cartoon realm. I'm glad he started the trend of performing using his voice in animations because there have been a good share of excellent movies because of that.
I need some attention over here. You are talking with a person on the computer all the time, talk to me.
Absolutely, my husband has had the same sport's coat for years!
Yeah that would be a lot of fun. I didn't realize that cats sleep so much. Must be nice.
I listen to it occasionally, but I have a hard time finding really good artists. Do you prefer mainstream hits or smaller artists you find on your own?
Maybe I am not sure but the singer was Joe Perry, lead guitarist of Aerosmith. It was nice chatting with you :)
And a way of expressing yourself it's like, you know, the examples that you gave do mean there's a whole lot more cynicism.
Awesome, your payment is processing. Please hold on a moment till I confirm your transaction.
Yes. They are into video games now (too much if you ask me). It's been fun talking ball with you! I enjoyed it. Have a good day!
talk to your friends about stuff like this I don't know you don't want to
I have to say House of Cards or Better Call Saul, what about yours?
really stuff like that but I learnt that from my family that's just how my family is, real tough, real discipline, real militaristic
He's like, oh my gosh. He would not like every time he drives me crazy. I'm watered out, I'm going to the bathroom every hour, I'm drinking a gallon a day.
Let me tell you those beds are so uncomfortable, you know they are older beds they don't get new stuff there and my back was killing me, I mean I'm so young
Do you still wanna rely on human error, or is tech gonna be that exact, and that's just how you're gonna play your game, down to the millimetre?
Oh wow that's very cool! Hey at least if you ever want to pick up a new show after, Nat Geo Wild has a show that parodies Game of Thrones but follows lions!
That's a safer translation. Well, I enjoyed chatting with you! Enjoy your Bible study!
Yes, I actually haven't seen him in a movie since American Beauty. I watch movies on Netflix sometimes. Do you?
I don't have a favorite but there are several that I like. How about yourself?
Yeah, it's what I'm trying to do myself, do you watch it or?
I vaguely recall reading something in the Star Wars fictional universe where a young Han Solo stayed with Chewbacca and his mom in their home.
Did I tell you about this friend who I hadn't talked to in a while, whom my mom asked me to invite
Well, if you l the villains then they are your super hero,
yeah! it was founded back in 1923 and it is definitely approaching 100 years. That seems really insane to me
Such gorgeous dogs! Do you & your dogs live in a northern climate?
this lady just spent like an insane amount of time with me going through all these potential boost and shoes and you know, my wife was just blown away because in Mexico
Do you shop on Amazon?
So, I'm gonna back to the email on January second.  well, that stuff gonna hit your credit card now. I hope so.
after going out saying you've got to go to school,
That's gonna be repeat actors. But I get it. Let's talk about your favourite movie genre.
we would wander around London at night. Because me and my dad can never fall asleep, we both have
I'm guessing that is because of TV and movies, we get this idea of the way it is shown when reality is somewhat different. Being self deprecating, I'd say a dunces cap suits me well.
yeah taking to the zoo you know what I'm saying
Shakira. Of course, the first thing is she can't deal with this air bubble-like all my computers messed me up.
I just want them to do them. You know what I mean.
If I could have an ideal profession, I did not have to worry about what it paid. What's your ideal profession?
it was you, we were talking about how someone in your contemporary acting class wanted to be a casting director and booked a backup job. I was thinking about that and how silly that is.
I feel bad for stray dogs sometimes. Istanbul has a vending machine that releases food and water for them if you recycle plastic bottles.
That's a good idea! Well, it's been fun and fast chatting with you this morning. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day, friend!
or just a lot of stuff that's really inexpensive so in comparison to a lot of other prices, so I honestly do and like ninety per cent of my grocery shopping, yeah.
Oh yeah I didn't know that either. I also want to go to google Plex to see the goats who mow their lawn by eating it.
from amazon using it, I can just talk out loud and tell it to order something for me, and it'll be delivered to my house for me. It's great.
you know just like somehow you know they were able to pack it in the bag and pull, they are all new and just drop it off over there
So that's why sometimes internet TV don't work for me, because I can't hear you say something ten minutes after your mouth say it. It ruins it. I don't see how you could do it.
Yea plus you can find yourself in trouble if you rely on google maps since they tailor disputed countries to the claims of each country depending on which country you are in
I've heard about that but never looked must have a lot of borinou reminded me, I really want to hear it for myself! That's very intriguing to me!
Putting the product in your hand before you even get there.
he is really in the organic stuff and fat-based stuff and this you know, green cleaners and organic sponges
you fall out of touch for a while that doesn't mean like, your relationship is done forever I don't know, what do you think?
I did not know about this fact. I am wondering if it is still in effect. By the way, nice chatting with you
where is your family originally come from where do you guys are if you point on a map
I never thought about that. Could you imagine washing your clothes in old faithful?
Yes I know a lot of computer languages as well but my degree was in math!   I did not know Serena was a co-owner of the Miami Dolphins!
Yes, your height is great for corner kicks. maybe as a goalie too. Anyway, great chat!
Well, San Diego will be more hot than warm. Really? Is there a meaning behind it? Or does it mean that you should not call your child after a band?
I did not know that either but I do like him as an actor. It was really nice chatting with you.
Me too, although its hard to rest for me these days I have twins, they keep going and going haha I spend a lot of time on the internet.
did you get it? Did you get it to sign in your phone?
The name Uranus always makes me laugh haha. I wish that we had another planet in our solar system no. Jupiter's moon Ganymede could actually be considered a planet if it orbited the Sun instead of being a moon
How frequently we meet our family? I see mine like twice a year really My parents that is
I agree, movies are becoming unrealistic like that, they have become too scaled, irrational.
you'd have to port your number over to somebody else and then they were like, I don't know what do you need the number for?
Ah, that's too bad haha. But unlike romance novels, I can't stay myself. But I had nice chat and I hope you have a nice day. Goodbye!
Hmm I am not sure, How do you even calculate that to be honest?
my dad text me saying Manny died I always knew uncle I just never met Manny
Yeah, I do, actually. I actually like ramen, but the ramen place that's near me.
But that's my news, but seeing at it, I cannot watch it, that I don't really, but Bloomberg, I watch Bloomberg TV
I figured that there would be friends of mine and people in my life, who he would meet as appropriate if they're showing up enough in the baby's life
I also love animals, I have a dog, but Ive been asking my husband for a dragon for years
To wash your laundry, to do the dishes and stuff, but you don't wanna drink it. So everyone's drinking bottled water.
No I didn't see that. It's interesting that 23 former Nationals attended it though, did you see it?
That is awesome. i think my favorie disney film would have to be either big hero 6 or the incredibles.
I would like to. it got good reviews. Anyway, great chat!
Yes. I mostly like the artwork on the cards. It's definitely better than watching the World Series baseball. I think my Grandpa used to call it the Fall Classic or something.
And it's  people who are interesting actors, but of course, my all-time favourite actor is the only actor, like celebrity actor that I really care about is Johnny Depp
Very true. Did you now polo shirts were initially invented be a famous tennis player?
OH my lord, when it sped up I got so anxious and you could basically bet I was going to lose wihtin a few pieces. The other day I was thinking about spy hunter. Did you ever play that game?
1 mb of RAM. Well if I had a memory, it would be forget only access, or 1 mb of FOA. Apple tells me that my warranty is void because of a bio hazard.
but he didn't say he was not invited for Thanksgiving and they talked about Cuba and everything and the next day my dad sends me a text, I am sorry
Yes! That is really my thought too. We need a president who has a very good head on their shoulders. How awesome would that be!
that must be an awesome spectacle to watch it eat. a good way to get rid of your enemies! LOL
it's like whatever, it's not my problem, they just take it.
Hahaaha, me neither. Well, I am surprised that crocodiles are closer related to birds than snakes and lizards, I don´t think they resemble a bird, cool
Yeah thinking about how much both franchises are worth is pretty crazy. Speaking of Batman, who was your favorite actor to play him?
as the years went on, it would become more and more can you remember when you first started buying things online for yourself?
Only if my team (Knicks) have a chance at the postseason, which is mostly no. I think they have a worse record than James Naismith's University of Kansas teams
Are you familiar with Native American books?
yeah same.  What are some of your favorite disney movies?
What do you think about the United Nations appointing an ambassador to extraterrestrials? I wonder what he does all day, sounds like the most boring job in the world because obviously we haven't had contact yet
I dunno because my friend told me that the women's world cup had higher television ratings than the world series.
He named me after his pops.
Well, on the profile it said this person visits your city frequently so it would open up an opportunity to meet them, once a month, twice a month,
Have you ever seen Big hero 6?
How was your day?
I guess the instrument would irritate your face over a long time period. Do you enjoy fantasy by any chance?
after a certain time at night or she won't answer text messages like on Sundays or something like that. So you are like setting boundaries for yourself
I mean maybe this is me again just like as you said living in my own reality, but from what I heard it was not going well for him.
Which is honestly just nuts. And when you combine Netflix and youtube, it's half of the peak internet traffic in North America alone!
And I'm curious to know if your friends in Israel were Americans or were they Israelis?
And I just had my writing. I give journal classes and I did posing classes. I couldn't write share Doctor Holland. You give me silver, you know, I can write fiction still.
Very much agreed. I contrast that experience with the experience I had with the overnight nurse at the hospital this time? The overnight nurse who tried to correct me with my pronouns?
It's all oil and then you can't. it's all oil and it turns into plastic,
When I went last summer I told my family, I appreciate you guys always driving us around everywhere, but I need to figure this around by myself.
yeah, it is a silly look. nobody wants to see your drawers. Have a good night!
Wouldn't that be something to see! Have you seen Thor? I tried to watch it but had a hard time following it.
Well, they're reopening now, but also everyone who works there. They're reopening there New Jersey my boyfriend maybe really wants to go with me and I really don't want to go
I think it is, I try to reward my kids efforts that seems to work with me, I also try to limit their social media use among other things.
Oh, my gosh. You'll have some great stories for your future grandkids let me tell you.
I used to but not any more. I love your tradition of waving to the chidlren's hospital. So touching.
I suppose talent could run in the family. I wonder what kind of personality you would need: spending hours inside your head, thinking of the moves and countermoves.
pettiness is my theme and I know. Just because I know myself, I know that I could stoop to some mean language
I agree! What kind of music do you like to listen to?
I would become wonder why though it gwonder why though.
Good Morning! Have you ever heard of K-Pop?
Probably, make up can really transform you into almost anyone
I didn't like it, so I used it for a month and I sent them back.
Are you sure that it's not something on your end? Maybe?
Im surprised that it is that high. i figured 1 percent maybe. i dont usually read them myself.
I love them! He cracks me up. I like corny goofball comedy. I used to like watching 3rd Rock from the Sun when it was on tv for that same reason.
Or head over to the mall and just spend your worries away. And then look at the state's credit card statement in a month and get more worried.
Stan lee is excellent writer also, he make the movie interesting. Which is your favourite sports ?
i don't believe i've seen those. i don't follow the marvel series too closely. i do know chris pratt plays a role in a show on tv, parks and rec. have you seen it?
Hey, you're never too old.  I'm a grandparent myself! Lol I did see Big Hero 6 with my grandsons and it's a good little cartoon movie.  Fantastic graphics it was made using a 55,000 core supercomputer.
You see what I hear from all the things that you've been telling me is that you found new communities for yourself.
I don't think my daughter took me to a restaurant. There's a lot of people from Hong Kong in Georgia. She loves that food and we went in, it was inside.
I have taken yoga before but I need a few more classes before I get more flexible. It was fun chatting with you, have a great day!
Haha. Funny. I don't eat seafood. My mom forced me to eat salmon way too often when I was little and I grew sick of it. Haha #firstworldproblems.
You know, as long as it fits. That's the biggest thing. When you were younger do you think you spent more money on clothes, and you put more time and energy into your outfits?
That is true. Did you hear about that time in 1957 when Truman refused to be photographed with Dumbo
You know like several hundred dollars more than they paid for them and kind of people do buy things specifically the sample sales with the intent of reselling,
I guess he's ok but he's not my favorite. But I am also an adult haha. I guess that during World War II he took a break from kids books and did some political stuff, I never knew that
Okay. So, what is your favorite game show?
i am no good at guitar myself, but that is cool of him, I know he uses coins as picks as well!
Wow that's impressive! Did you realize that airplanes travel 10% slower these days? They do it to save fuel but you also get to your destination slower
It is, it has an italian pronunciation and Gucci was founded in 1921. I used to like the Pawn shop because of all the history and facts you discovered in the show.
I wanted to ask you since your friend lives in Dubai you went to visit? Did you notice, you said something about the souk. I can't say it, I don't know why?
and there was a girl in front me who was too giant like carts that she wheeled over there and staffs and I was watching her pull out of the side pairs and pairs of a direct sweats
She's in the living room and I'm in the kitchen, I can hear and I can focus on that, but she wants me to move my body over so she can see that I am focused on her.
It's important to lay out your position. Televising not just the handshake, but also that message is greatly important.
Now you got me shook. I'm like oh my God! Like no, but really we discussed that I am not like that type of person that I don't need that.
Really? I bet that was wild. I didn't think I'd ever need to know much about it myself. We were actually talking about Wayne Rooney a little bit ago.
I think its a really long and boring name lol, I do like to play video games as well do you have a PlayStation system?
What about your job, do they actively recycle? No, I find most restaurants in New York City do not care about recycling, they just throw everything in the trash.
Maybe you're going to some kind of event or restaurant. When you're doing something like that, how much thought do you put into your outfit?
Yeah too much pc is lame for me, to me you should be able to create whatever content you want and if its bad then its bad and people wont like it because it sucks.
Haha me too, got to learn to skate first. I am going to take off though, great chatting with you.
(Well, I remember) I have a question for you. Did you have multiple, the best way to explain is to explain how my town works
Can you imagine being falsely imprisoned for 10 years and spend most of the time at a library trying to prove your Innocence?
I have not, its on my to do list lol I love animal shows too.
What do you think of Serena Williams?
let me just check in with my wife and I'll shoot you a text
Because they turn over so quick that I always challenge myself to find whatever is the cheapest best place you can get to from the Canal station. You know
I totally agree with you but on the other hand, it is kind of cool and makes the movies more realistic.  Although Mission Impossible-Fallout is pretty far out there as far as realism goes.
part of my daughter's. the comments that she has was from me talking I remember them rolling their eyes going to stop talking mum
it's sort of like, okay, everything's sort of coming together. This is nice. and my mom messaged me saying, Oh, you know, would you like to stay with Stella, who's a family friend of ours?
No, this was my very first time and they told me that to get to the bunny hill I had to take the ski lift and I bought it.
I guess you(me) really do learn something new everyday! In case this chat ends unexpectedly, it was really great chatting with you today!
I guess the lesson is, don't trust your life to the planets, or a paid advise columnist.
Have you ever been on a blind date?
I do,  actually I shop at the Trader Joe's liquor store, I don't shop at the Trader Joe's
Well, President of the United States, I wonder if he had them in the White House? Did he have a stable for the bear out back?
