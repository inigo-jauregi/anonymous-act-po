Well, your dog can't help. I would the chips off the floor too! They're CHIPS. Can't go to waste.
Doing better, of course, the other thing is the whole tax situation, which is the return for an independent contractor so you know, or you have to be responsible for paying your taxes quarterly and you know?
Not any more but I used to. I do like knowing that in Norway the government will buy copies your book that you publish and put them in libraries. It sounds like they really support their libraries.
wow that would be so crazy and intense. I would like to be part of that though some day. I wonder who makes them now. Good chatting with you!
I think I would have to say Marvel, I grew up watching shows and reading those comics. How about yourself?

I honestly like their stand on this. THey have made great careers why would they need a star. Nice chatting with you.
Yeah, I mean and then there's the other point of Amazon besides just product regulation is that the company itself is growing so big and taking your part of Sony from the industry.
you know that you gotta go to school for that, you know what I am saying.
That was good. I heard of him. On another topic, do you use your cell phone a lot?
Looked very cool, when he did it! I heard somewhere that Tupac danced ballet. Have you heard anything about that?
Yeah so like, when you go in and buy your phone for example, that's from T-mobile or any T-mobile
I agree with you. Michael Bay is an ok director though, he directed the movie The Rock which is really good.

Are you saying that I don't have your best interest at heart
Your family don't even gotta be your reckless family members. They could be people just add on to your family and stuff like that.
Awesome, your payment is processing. Please hold on a moment till I confirm your transaction.
you know, it's like fields trip field day, you know field day

how do you feel like he helped out through the various stages in your life?
Yeah, you should give it a try, I wonder what surprises will bring this years awards!

because it is just wild that when we think about it it's just like
Are you sure that it's not something on your end? Maybe?
You know, if your customer's like oh, I'm gonna buy more. It's like, no that's not a good thing.

But what will you do with your time? Immortality goes on for quite a while. Fish don't have to be entertained, but we do.

He never reached out and was like, you never sorry for biting your arm.
I can't even imagine working that hard for a role and not getting it! I did watch Ironman all the way thru. How bout you?

That sounds like that makes a lot of sense, your next step.
Yes I agree with you! I watch YouTube almost everyday. I can't believe that Google bought YouTube for 1.65 billion dollars back in 2006. That seems like so long ago

And so are most of your friends nowadays from your acro community?
do your parents use a DVD player?
Yes, if it is your criteria, then video game is a legitimate sport. They have leagues and a lot of betting is done on matches.

That is an honor. Would Miami be your team being from Florida? They had some glory years not that long ago.
Yeah, you can just get rid of it, I mean cut your cost.
I think even your PayPal email address.

It's funny when you think about it, isn't it? I mean, a mouse had such a profound effect on everyone and everything.
It's just your mic is blasting in my ear. I got up to lower it.
that should work cause then I can just, you know, in the morning or whatever.
I know, I haven't seen it. How lucky to find baseball cards in your grandfathers attic worth 3 million dollars! Good chat!!
Not really, never did, nor saw the attraction in it, how about yourself?
between meters and just everything, and even just worrying about your car getting clipped. Parking is a real pain in the butt. How do you find parking in Astoria?
Who was your favorite nemesis in Superman? I loved lex luther
it could be like a belt-like, you can latch it on to yourself like even. It's just the possibility like this is more functional than a pop socket
Wow! That is like a premonition. I guess I will make a joke about winning Power Ball. I guess you know that the raptors are not computer generated, but are people in dinosaur suits?
I wonder if that is the same for all entertainers? Box office success often brings groupies. Hard to resist when you're on the road away from your family, isn't it? What is your other favorite entertainment?
What's your hope for your kids and stuff like that. If you could take the whole thing. How your parents treated you, your kids. What, how would you do that?
